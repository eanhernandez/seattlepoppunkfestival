<p><strong>Who is <a href="http://www.tdrecs.com/">top drawer records</a>?
</strong></p>
<p>Basically it's just Ean from
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PunkRockSicko/">Sicko</a> and his cat Alan, a 
small affair run out of a Crown Hill basement with equal parts love and meow 
mix. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Who is on the LP? </strong></p>
<p>Check out <a href="thebands.html">The Bands</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What format will it be on? </strong></p>
<p>12” Vinyl + digital downloads. </p>
<p><strong>Why are you doing this? </strong></p>
<p>The concept: way back in the protopopunk days of 1993, I had the idea of 
putting out a pop punk compilation. Most people didn't understand what Pop and 
Punk had to do with each other, and others just mocked us for a dumb idea. Which 
was fair enough, because there were only two pop punk bands in town anyway: 
Sicko and the Fastbacks. Stretching the definition, we could add the Young Fresh 
Fellows and the Model Rockets. Not much of a comp. So, we had to go to Canada to 
get Bum, the Smugglers, Cub, and the Stand, and down to California to get the Mr 
T Experience, and started to round out what became a pretty cool record:
<a href="https://www.discogs.com/Various-13-Soda-Punx/release/1897423">13 Soda 
Punx</a> (still have a
<a href="https://tdrecs.com/products/13-soda-punx-various-cd-lp">few for sale!</a>)...after 
wrapping up the label, moving away from Seattle, going to grad school, living 
abroad, and coming home again, I wanted to play some shows in my new band
<a href="http://www.datenightwithbrian.com">Date Night with Brian</a>. So I 
asked Brian Foss "are there any pop punk bands in Seattle?" He put me in touch 
with a bunch of people (Crusher, West, Rev) who showed me that Seattle not only 
has pop punk bands, but it has a TON of awesome pop punk bands. What a change 
from the 1990s!!! So, I feel compelled to document what is a beautiful thing: 
the music I love is also loved by lots of swell people. </p>
<p>Fast forward about a year, and we are having a record release party.&nbsp; I 
thought it would be cool to have a few bands from 13 Soda Punx play as well, so 
the K Streets, Bum, and Sicko have agreed to join the 14 bands from the current 
Soda Punx release.</p>
<p><strong>Why the hell is this called 14 Soda Punx? </strong></p>
<p>Because the last one was called 13 Soda Punx. </p>
<p><strong>Why the hell was the last one called 13 Soda Punx? </strong></p>
<p>Because the artist that drew the original cover, Pablo Griggs, took my 
limited input of "Pop", "Punk", "no tits or needles or dragsters" (in the 90's 
there was actually a danger of this happening) and decided to make up a name and 
embed it in the artwork, so we would have had to lose the artwork to change the 
name. So Pablo got to name it. Which was slightly annoying, but it looked cool, 
so we went with it. I never really considered myself a Punx, but what the heck, 
I don't really like being called a "Sicko" either. Names choose you. </p>
<p><strong>When is it going to come out? </strong></p>
<p>The same night as the release show, January 19th.</p>
<p><strong>How many copies will be pressed? </strong></p>
<p>500 on RED VINYL.&nbsp; Cooooooool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love you all,</p>
